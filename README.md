# JM Designs - Front-End Developer Digital Resume

## Purpose
To showcase abilities as a designer and front-end developer.

## Languages/Frameworks Used
This website was built using a theme from author Creative-Tim.
The theme was built on Angular 7 and Bootstrap 4.

I then took the theme, heavily customized the components, removing what I did not need and changing colors and how the file structure was implemented.

The design for the website was my own except for each individual component design. I created the design using Sketch.

I achieved this design through updating certain elements to utilize more of HTML5. I also achieved this through editing the SASS and writing new Angular 7 components and pages into the project. I also updated the accessibility of the theme, as it was lacking heavily in this area.

The skills images are mostly all SVG files. I downloaded them in the color black and then recolored them to match each respective brand.
